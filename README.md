# Welcome to Gafar's Make or Remove Bucket Repository

# One Script will create S3 bucket and tag the bucket with appropriate name

# Other script will delete bucket with appropriate name

# read command will prompt you to enter the name of bucket name you wish to create 

The make-bucket script has 2 functions: one will create a bucket with the name you have entered and the other will tag the bucket. Please make sure your bucket name is unique and is the correct format.

The remove-bucket script will delete the bucket if the bucket exists, else it will display a "bucket does not exist or you do not have permissions" message.

# Hope this is helpful, thanks!
